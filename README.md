# Credit Card Issues

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's accrued debt.
The card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. There are two credit card groups: consumer credit cards and business credit cards.

# Common credit card issues faced by Customers :-
1) Many credit card users think the minimum amount due is the total due amount they have to pay, it makes them assume their bill is low and spend even more, accruing interest on their outstanding. It could build up to a huge amount over a period of time which they are unable to manage.
2) There are a number of fees and hidden charges that users are unaware of and come to know of only after they start using the credit card. So some people cancel there credit cards.
3) Sometimes when you are unable to pay your dues, you are charged more interest.
4) Sometimes, there are incidents of credit card frauds in which a person clones your credit card and spends with it giving you a huge bill.
